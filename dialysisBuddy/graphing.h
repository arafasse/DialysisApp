// a matlab interface might not be our best option, because then we'd either need to store the program on our SD card (probably not remotely possible or advisable) or interface with wifi. There's no point having people run matlab on their own data, cuz they're not going to have access to that software in any way, shape or form... Tis a pity though, cuz Matlab is SO. EASY. and perfect for this sort of graphing application. But it won't work here. :( 
// Ooooh. Would R work????
